# FruitCut Kids - A Fun & Safe Game Collection

Welcome to FruitCut Kids, a modern, fun, and safe online game collection designed for children and families. This project was inspired by a 6-year-old boy from China and his dad, who wanted to create a platform for kids around the world to share their favorite games and interests.
